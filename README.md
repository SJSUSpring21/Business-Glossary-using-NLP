# Detailed Explanation
**Social Media Fraud**
> > In the present era, online social networks have ended up progressively well known, people’s social lives have ended up more associated with these social networks. We often use social platforms to share news, organize events and even run e-business. With the rapid growth of online social networks and the gigantic sum of individual information have pulled in attackers and imposters to steal personal data, share false news and spread malicious activities. Here we propose to use efficient Machine Learning algorithms to detect abnormal activities and fake accounts. 

**Chatbot Task Scheduler**
> > Scheduling tasks for people in a co-working space is a tedious task. There's a lot of tools in the market for scheduling tasks for a team or group but have below par user experience. By incorporating the convenience of a chat bot into the repetitious job of task scheduling. The CTS helps members of an organization schedule tasks by simply having a conversation and prepares analytical reports for weekly/monthly conduction of work.

**Access Food Utilization**
> > Nowadays, a lot of food is wasted in the households So, what we are planning to do is make a website wherein people can upload the left-over food and the quantity. People living nearby can take it at a cheap cost. Apart from this, this app can also be used for many purposes like if someone is indian and he is craving from an Indian food like samosas, then one can look into the app (using filters ) and fulfill their cravings. Hence during this pandemic, where food is the most important thing, this app can be really useful.





**Create domain specific business glossary using NLP**
Create domain specific business glossary using NLP

Introduction to the topic: 

Vertical taxonomies such as an e-commerce taxonomy for retailers, telecom taxonomy for Telecom. Businesses will be able to bring their domain specific private documents and the NLP based AI system will create a well formed taxonomies ingestible into a common catalog.The project will eventually help a particular enterprise in accurate decision making with the comprehensive view of all the business terms . With the data being organised in one place, this project helps the enterprise to save a lot of time by automatically cataloging the data.


Abstract:
	
	What is the cost of developing glossaries for a given set of business documents?
How reusable is a business glossary for the processes carried out on average in a
Company?
Impact of developing a glossary/taxonomy for a company/business?
Correlation between assimilating new employees and strength of data catalogs.


Approach: 

The project will have business enterprises as their users. Once they upload a document, the document will be scanned using python’s famous libraries like document-scanner or py-tesseract tool . After that , once the data is retrieved from the document, Natural Language Processing will be rendered on it and it will extract all the business-related terms . The end-product will be deployed on the dashboard.



Persona:
Majorly there will be two types of personas. 
One will be the end user who will use the system to acquire information from the business glossary. This user will use the glossary to understand business processes from upper management or lower management. This user can also use this tool for on-boarding process to learn about company functions
The second type of user will use the tool but also submit the corpuses(documents) through which the tool will develop taxonomies. This user has the ability to update the corpuses and thus update the glossaries.
