People living nearby can take it at a cheap cost. Apart from this, this app can also be used for many purposes like if someone is indian and he is craving from an Indian food like samosas, then one can look into the app (using filters ) and fulfill their cravings. Hence during this pandemic, where food is the most important thing, this app can be really useful.

**Social Media Fraud**

Here we propose to use efficient Machine Learning algorithms to detect abnormal activities and fake accounts.
